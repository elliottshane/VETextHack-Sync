# sme-hackathon
 This is a quick app I wrote that uses twilio sms, twilio-sync and twilio functions to collect votes from the audience when they vote on the teams working on AI soluntions @ out hackaton for VEText. THe Functions are in the function directory. This is what processes the incoming sms messages, gives you a token and places them in a sync object. Then the rest of this repository has a vue.js web app that adds up and displays the scores.
